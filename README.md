  JavaScript BDD Code Review
  Find and Replace

  Create a website where a user enters a string, chooses a word to find and provides a replacement for that word.

  Sample input: "Hello world"

  Find string: "world"

  Replace string: "universe"

  Output: "Hello universe"

  Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

  Complete spec coverage
  All specs are passing (indicating that your Javascript function(s) are working as designed if you have thorough specs in place)
  Logic is easy to understand
  Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (likeThis)
  Code has proper indentation and spacing
  Grade yourself before you submit!
