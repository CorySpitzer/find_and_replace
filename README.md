  JavaScript BDD Code Review
  Find and Replace

  Create a website where a user enters a string, chooses a word to find and
  provides a replacement for that word.

  Sample input: "Hello world"

  Find string: "world"

  Replace string: "universe"

  Output: "Hello universe"

  Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

  Complete spec coverage
  *All specs are passing (indicating that your Javascript function(s) are
  working as designed if you have thorough specs in place)
  *Logic is easy to understand
  *Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (likeThis)
  *Code has proper indentation and spacing
  Grade yourself before you submit!
